# github-final-project

A simple interest calculator built to support a microfinance startup empowering individuals with low income.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This script demonstrates how to calculate **simple interest**, serving as a base for future financial tools that the startup will offer. It's part of the gradual migration from SVN to Git and GitHub.

## 💡 Simple Interest Formula

\[
\text{Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- `P` is the principal amount
- `R` is the annual interest rate
- `T` is the time (in years)

## 🛠️ Usage

The script will accept input values and return the calculated simple interest.
